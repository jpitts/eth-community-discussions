## General context:

**Eth Roadmap changes**

[A rollup-centric ethereum roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) - EthMagicians post by Vitalik Buterin

> The eth2 roadmap offers scalability, and the earlier phases of eth2 are approaching quickly, but base-layer scalability for applications is only coming as the last major phase of eth2, which is still years away. 
> In a further twist of irony, eth2’s usability as a data availability layer for rollups comes in phase 1, long before eth2 becomes usable for “traditional” layer-1 applications. 
> These facts taken together lead to a particular conclusion: **the Ethereum ecosystem is likely to be all-in on rollups (plus some plasma and channels) as a scaling strategy for the near and mid-term future**.

[The State of Eth2, Jan 2021](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/01/20/the-state-of-eth2-january-2021/#eth1--eth2--ethereum) - EF Blog post by Danny Ryan

> These designations – eth1 / eth2 – imply a false sequentiality. They imply that eth1 will be deprecated in favor of eth2, that one is being left behind for the other. Instead, the terms actually represent different layers of the stack.

**EIP-1559 objections, 51% protest against EIP-1559**

[Mar 7, 2021 Tweet by Red Panda Mining](https://twitter.com/RedPandaMining/status/1368625214674796550)

> For educational purposes, let's collectively move our hash to http://ethermine.org April 1st for 51 hours.

**Concerns about environmental impact of NFTs / Ethereum PoW**

[Mar 9, 2021 Tweet by Daniel Irizarri](https://twitter.com/Danielirizarri/status/1369297919447334917)

> Talking about the harsh environmental costs of crypto and NFT minting/trading it's hard to visualize why that is or what that looks like. 
> 
> now, look at this fucking monstrosity hauling more power than nearby towns and tell me this is what you want for the future.

[Mar 12, 2021 Tweet by Simon Stålenhag](https://twitter.com/simonstalenhag/status/1370305951006351360)

> I don't think there's anything wrong with artists getting super rich, but I do despise the idea of art trade and the speculation, money laundering and tax evasion that comes with it. NFT is great for all that too, but has the added bonus of being super bad for the environment.

[Quick merge via fork choice change](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/B1mUf6DXO) - Note by Vitalik Buterin

[reddit discussion about "Quick merge"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m36nrl/quick_merge_via_fork_choice_change/)

> So Vitalik does seem committed to speeding up POS merge.
> 
> Makes sense. Ethereum development is getting hit by environmentally concerned media on one side and by miners themselves on the other. The merge deals with both.
> 
> > I don't think he is speeding it up, he just offers quick fixes if resistance to PoS or EIP1559 result in a miner attack. Basically saying if miners try to increase their profits by delaying/canceling the improvements planned, we can kick them out a lot sooner, making them lose the fees they would have generated (~4 months until EIP1559 and maybe ~10 months until the merge on a normal schedule).

[When PoW miners think it is a good idea to take a "show of force" approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m3gaga/when_pow_miners_think_it_is_a_good_idea_to_take_a/) - reddit discussion

[Ethereum Miners Protesting EIP-1559 Has Accelerated Upgrade to ETH 2.0 🏃‍♂️](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m3ikeg/ethereum_miners_protesting_eip1559_has/) - reddit discussion

> It had accelerated nothing, problem is just bigger.
>
> > No hate, that’s a realistic take. The title kind of implies that the core devs haven’t been pushing towards PoS for many years - which, as someone who has followed the project since 2017 knows is false. Also if you read the article there is no demonstration of causality between miners being upset and an acceleration of the roadmap. Such hype only serves to let people down. Come back to this post in a year and see how well it aged.

[With discussions of prioritising merging ETH 1.0 into ETH 2.0 PoS rather than prioritising sharding, what are the potential timelines?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/m4rznu/with_discussions_of_prioritising_merging_eth_10/) - reddit discussion

> Unfortunately we're now in full-on hash war blustering mode so you can no longer trust anything anyone says.
> 
> I don't think anyone ever made promises about giving miners time to transition. Previously it sounded like it would be technically ambitious to get it done this year but maybe just possible. Then the other day /u/vbuterin dropped a simpler design that could be done faster, with the implication that if the miners fucked around over EIP1559 they'd quickly be fired. I've long been baffled that we're bathing in drama fighting predictable opposition from the miners over 1559 rather than just getting on with the merge so it doesn't matter what the miners think, but hopefully somebody involved knows what they're doing.
> 
> > The simpler design wasn't something that we knew about but decided not to do until now we decided we do want to do it. Rather, we (Danny and myself) literally came up with the simpler design within the last week. Sometimes even simple ideas really are very hard to come up with but then when you get pulled into a different mindset a new idea suddenly becomes very clear and obvious; such things happen in protocol research all the time. As another example, theoretically nothing was stopping us from converging on optimistic rollups back in 2016, as all the ideas (shadow chains, stateless clients) were already there at the time.
