## [Perception of the Ethereum UX](https://medium.com/metacartel/perception-of-the-ethereum-ux-d39b89da0008) by Lili Feyerabend

The survey was divided into five sections:

1) Qualification
2) Segmentation
3) Relative preference
4) User expectation
5) User pain points

"Contrary to popular belief, the respondents affirmed that Ethereum’s biggest barrier to adoption lay in the realm of product design rather than technological capacity and network performance."

## [Research Is Not Enough](https://hackernoon.com/https-medium-com-okduncan-research-is-not-enough-moreexperiementation-404f69d20e52) by James Duncan

UX remains an aching blindspot in the Ethereum ecosystem.
- Despite being available, very few applications are utilizing the capability of layer two solutions
- There will be many high powered chains that come in to eat Ethereum’s lunch 
- A higher rate of shipping should result in more detailed adjustments

[Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) by Nick Szabo

We present intuitive arguments for why micropayments have not succeeded
on the Internet. The "hassle factor" for customers associated with such transactions
is characterized. A framework of mental transaction costs and price
granularity is then presented, and arguments about micropayments recast in its
light. Finally, we make some suggestions for reducing the mental transaction
costs of Internet commerce.
