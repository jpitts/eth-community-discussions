# Ethereum Foundation Decentralization

The EF currently consistents of independent teams which are self-organized, but coordinate. The Stiftung Ethereum in Zug has adopted a mission to promote and support the Ethereum platform, and this is expressed by the greater EF in the funding of operations, research, development, events, and grants.

Certain teams have a much stronger influence due to their legal/jurisdictional position and capacity to allocate resources. Some teams are more under the control of resource-bearing teams e.g. operations. Generally, however, the EF is decentralized.

A key asset of the EF is its trademark "Ethereum". How this is enforced says a lot about the orientation of the EF toward the community.

Certain stakeholders at the Ethereum Foundation advocate that the organization continue to decentralize, possibly even atomize and cease to exist except in the most minimal form.

Evidence of this orientation can be found in the following:

[Decentralization by Elimination](https://www.decentralizedweb.net/videos/talk-decentralization-by-elimination/) - Aya Miyagichi and Albert Ni

"Decentralization has become a buzzword. A marketing gimmick. Without the elimination of centralized authorities, there cannot be true decentralization. How does an organization eliminate itself for the better future of the decentralized web?"
