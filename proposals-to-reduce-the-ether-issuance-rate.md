Initial links relating to proposals to cap the total ether supply or reduce the ether issuance rate

Proposals:
- EIP 960 proposes a [cap to the total ether supply](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/960), ending the linear issuance rate.
- EIP 186 proposed to [reduce the ether issuance rate before Casper / PoS](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/186)
